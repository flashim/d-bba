              >I would first like to say the Basic program you have started on
              is just the start of your martial arts experience. Once you start
              your basics and get to grips with the way we learn and train you
              will be ready to get on the path to black belt. So basic training
              is a maximum of 6 months however moving on to the a black belt
              program will be done in a lot shorter time. Speak to your
              instructor when you feel your ready and he or she will definitely
              approach you if they feel your ready.</em

            I would like to just go through a few things about being a member at

            1. Class timetable
          </div>
          <div class="notes-text">
            We know from long experience that students who set a fixed time each
            week to attend class enjoy their training for longer. Try to ensure
            that you attend class at least once a week to build attendance into
            your routine. This is also important for children and helps prevent
            them from dropping out of the program.

          <div class="notes-text">
            We are a black belt school and the vision is to get to Black Belt.
            Attending Belt testing is mandatory at the academy as the vision is
            to train to black belt. If youâ€™re an absolute beginner, you will be
            working towards your first 3 belts when you start and if you are an
            experienced new member, we will assess were you are at going
            forward. Belt testing is every 2 months and the dates is posted on
            the notice boards in the academy. One coming up the stairs and the
            other near the restroom entrance.
